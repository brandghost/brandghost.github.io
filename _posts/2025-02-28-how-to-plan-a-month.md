## Step 1: Define Your Content Streams (10 Minutes)

Before you start creating content, you need a structured approach. The best way to stay consistent and engaging is to categorize your posts into content streamsâ€”thematic buckets that align with your brandâ€™s voice and audience interests.

Example Content Streams:

ðŸŽ¯ Educational: Industry tips, how-to guides, or insights

ðŸš€ Promotional: Product features, testimonials, and offers

ðŸ˜‚ Engaging: Polls, memes, trending topics

ðŸ“… Evergreen: Quotes, repurposed blog content, FAQs

ðŸ‘¥ Community-Focused: User-generated content, shoutouts

_Using BrandGhost:_

BrandGhost's Topic Streams feature helps you categorize posts for easy scheduling. Set up your core content categories so you can distribute them evenly throughout the month.

## Step 2: Generate Content Ideas (10 Minutes)

Once you have your content streams, brainstorm 4-5 post ideas per category. If you're feeling stuck, use AI-powered brainstorming to speed up the process.

Quick Idea-Generation Hacks:

- Repurpose Old Content: Turn past blog posts into social snippets.

- Leverage FAQs: Answer common customer questions in a short post.

- Use AI for Suggestions: BrandGhostâ€™s AI can generate remixed content based on your draft content.

## Step 3: Batch-Create Social Media Posts (20 Minutes)

Now itâ€™s time to write and design your posts. Instead of creating content one post at a time, batch-create an entire monthâ€™s worth by focusing on one content type at a time.

How to Batch-Create Efficiently:

- Write all your educational posts first.

- Then, move on to promotional content.

- Create engaging posts next (memes, polls, etc.).

- Finish with evergreen content and community highlights.

- Schedule evergreen posts (quotes, FAQs) on slow days.

_Using BrandGhost:_

BrandGhost allows you to schedule posts weeks in advance, so you can:

âœ… Automatically queue up evergreen content

âœ… Post at the best times based on engagement data

âœ… Preview your posts, Instagram grid to ensure visual brand consistency

### Step 5: Automate & Repurpose Content (10 Minutes)

Now that your posts are scheduled, let automation take over. However, you can also repurpose high-performing content to save time in the future.

_Repurposing Strategies:_
