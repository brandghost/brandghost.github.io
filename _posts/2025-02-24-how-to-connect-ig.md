# Using BrandGhost with Instagram: Why Your Instagram Business Account Must Be Tied to a Facebook Page

If you're looking to streamline your social media management with BrandGhost, it's essential to understand Instagram's API requirements. One of the most common hurdles users face is the necessity of linking an Instagram Business Account to a Facebook Page. This requirement is set by Meta (the parent company of both Facebook and Instagram) and applies to all third-party platforms, including BrandGhost.

## Why Does Instagram Require a Facebook Page?

Instagram's API permissions are governed by Meta, and access to posting, analytics, and other business features is only available through the Facebook Graph API. To enable these features, your Instagram Business Account must be connected to a Facebook Page. This ensures:

- **Enhanced Security**: Connecting to Facebook helps Meta verify that only authorized users manage business profiles.
- **Access to Business Features**: Features like scheduling posts, retrieving insights, and managing comments require API access, which is only granted when the account is linked.
- **Centralized Management**: With a linked Facebook Page, businesses can manage their presence across both platforms more effectively, including running ads and cross-posting content.

## How to Link Your Instagram Business Account to a Facebook Page

If you haven't linked your Instagram Business Account to a Facebook Page yet, follow these steps:

### 1. Convert Your Instagram Account to a Business Account

1. Open the Instagram app and go to **Settings**.
2. Navigate to **Account** > **Switch to Professional Account**.
3. Select **Business** and follow the prompts.

### 2. Link Instagram to a Facebook Page

1. Go to **Settings** on your Instagram profile.
2. Tap **Linked Accounts** or **Business Tools & Controls**.
3. Choose **Facebook** and sign in to your Facebook account.
4. Select the appropriate Facebook Page you manage.

### 3. Verify the Connection in Facebook Business Suite

1. Open **Facebook Business Suite** (business.facebook.com).
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Instagram Accounts**.
3. Ensure your Instagram account appears as connected.

## Using BrandGhost with Your Instagram Business Account

Once your Instagram Business Account is linked to a Facebook Page, you're ready to connect it to BrandGhost:

1. Log in to BrandGhost and navigate to **Social Platforms**.
2. Select Add Platform + and then "Meta > Connect", which will prompt you to log in via Facebook.
3. Grant Permissions, ensuring that BrandGhost has access to manage Instagram content.
4. Complete the Setup, and you'll be able to schedule posts, manage comments, and analyze insights directly from BrandGhost.

Missing permissions: Reauthorize access by visiting Facebook Business Integrations and ensuring BrandGhost has all necessary permissions.
