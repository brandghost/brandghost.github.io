## Why Mastodon?

Mastodon is a rapidly growing decentralized social network where communities thrive on open communication and authenticity. As more brands and creators look for alternatives to traditional social platforms, Mastodon has become an essential part of the online conversation — and we want to make sure you’re right there with them.

## What You Can Do with Mastodon on BrandGhost

Starting today, you can:

- Publish and schedule posts to your Mastodon accounts directly from your BrandGhost dashboard

- Manage and reply to comments from Mastodon alongside your other social platforms

- Preview your upcoming Mastodon content and stay consistent with your broader content strategy

Whether you're nurturing a new Mastodon presence or growing an already-thriving community, BrandGhost gives you the tools to keep your messaging aligned and your workflow seamless.

## How to Connect Your Mastodon Account

It’s easy:

1. Head to Social Platforms in BrandGhost.

2. Click Connect Add Platform and select Mastodon.

3. Enter your instance name, then follow the prompts to authorize BrandGhost with your Mastodon account.

4. That’s it — you’re ready to start posting!

### What’s Next?

Adding Mastodon is just the beginning. We're committed to continually expanding BrandGhost’s support for the platforms and tools you care about most. If there’s another network you’d love to see us integrate with, let us know — your feedback helps guide our roadmap.

Thank you for being part of the BrandGhost community. We can't wait to see what you create next — now, on Mastodon too.

Happy posting!
