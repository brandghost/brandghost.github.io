# How BrandGhost Saves Time and Boosts Impressions - A Success Story with Thimo Koolen

For content creators and business owners, staying ahead of the social algorithms can feel like a constant battle. Maintaining engagement and growing an audience requires both consistency and strategy. But what if you could optimize your posting workflow, freeing up time to focus on content that truly resonates? Enter BrandGhost.ai—a powerful tool that is changing the game for creators like Thimo.

## The Challenge: Fighting Algorithm Fatigue

Like many creators, Thimo noticed a shift in his engagement over the past few weeks.

“The algorithm is definitely liking my posts less the past two weeks,” he shared. “At least now BrandGhost gives me time to make videos!”

With impressions fluctuating and content trends evolving, it’s easy to feel discouraged. But instead of getting stuck in the cycle of declining reach, Thimo turned to a smarter solution —BrandGhost— to help him work more efficiently while still improving results.

## The BrandGhost Advantage: More Time, More Impact

Before using BrandGhost, Thimo spent a lot of time manually scheduling, writing, and optimizing posts. With BrandGhost’s automation, he was able to free up time to create new videos—a format that the algorithm currently favors.

The results? One of his best-performing days of the year.

## Leveraging Trends: Visuals & Tweet-Style Posts

Social media trends move fast, and Thimo has been quick to adapt.

“I recently see more people with 'tweet-style' visuals on their posts, which basically summarize their core message, and then the full message in the post itself.”

With BrandGhost’s scheduling and analytics, he’s been able to test different formats and strategies, helping him identify what drives the most engagement. He found that posts with visuals tend to generate more impressions, reinforcing the importance of content diversity. In addition, BrandGhost's Caption to Screenshot feature allows him to create those tweet-style image posts with one click.

## The Takeaway: Consistency + Smart Automation = Growth

Thimo’s experience highlights a key lesson for creators: Consistency is crucial, but so is adaptability. By using BrandGhost to automate his core posting schedule, he gained the flexibility to focus on content that performs—whether that’s videos, tweet-style posts, or other high-engagement formats.

His journey also underscores an important mindset shift:

“It’s interesting to see though (and also easily disheartening), but that’s where I need to keep pushing through.” 💪

The key is not to give up when impressions dip but to use the right tools—like BrandGhost—to work smarter, not harder.
