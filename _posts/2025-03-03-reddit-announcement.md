## BrandGhost launches Reddit Support!

For too long, creators and brands have struggled to cross-post to their Reddit profile pages.

At BrandGhost, we believe your voice should be heard wherever your audience is—and that includes your personal Reddit profile. That’s why we’re excited to roll out direct cross-posting to Reddit profiles, making it easier than ever to share content, engage with your followers, and grow your presence on the platform.

## Why This Matters

Reddit has evolved beyond just subreddits—it’s where creators, thought leaders, and brands engage directly with their communities. Whether you’re sharing insights, posting updates, or sparking discussions, your profile page is an extension of your brand.

Until now, scheduling tools have limited Reddit posting to subreddits only, leaving profile posting as a manual afterthought. With BrandGhost, you can now:

✅ Schedule posts directly to your Reddit profile

✅ Cross-post seamlessly across platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Bluesky, and now Reddit)

✅ Plan ahead and maintain a consistent posting schedule
